# Neoepitope prediction (St Jude)

**This repository contains the source code for the workflow of HLA typeing and neoepitope prediction. The pipelines are available for use on DNAnexus.**

Here you'll find the source code for two applets implementing individual pipeline stages, and python scripts in the root directory to build the applets and instantiate DNAnexus [workflows](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/UI/Workflows) using them. You'll need the [DNAnexus SDK](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Quickstart) installed and set up to run these scripts.
